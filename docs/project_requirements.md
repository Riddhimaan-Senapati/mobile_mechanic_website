As a mobile mechanic, I need a straightforward website that makes it easy for customers to learn about my services, check my service area, and book appointments without having to call. The site should clearly display all the important information and allow customers to see my availability and receive confirmation when they book. Customers should also be able to create an account to view or cancel their bookings and message me directly with questions or concerns. Having this system in place will make my business feel more professional and save time for both me and my customers.
 
Most wanted features:

1.User-friendly interface with all relevant info
2.Appointment booking system
3.Customer accounts (sign up/login) to view/modify bookings
4.In-site messaging between customer and mechanic
Nice to have features:
5.Google Calendar sync 
6.SMS/email reminders for appointments
